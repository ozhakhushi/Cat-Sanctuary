## 🌌 Gameplay & Core Loop

Story:

A Person looking for a new job to get away from home finally gets a job at a cat sanctuary. The Cat sanctuary hides its dark past behind the dark veil of night.

- **Explore** the chilling, atmospheric environment.
- **Locate** the cursed, fragmented remains of the former caretaker.
- **Evade** cunning demonic traps and terrifying jumpscares.
